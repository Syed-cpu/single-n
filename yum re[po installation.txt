
How to Setup Local Yum Repository using installation DVD or ISO on RHEL 8 .

Repositories are generally stored on a public network, which can be accessedby multiple users on the internet. However, you can create your own local repositoryon your server and access, it as a single user or allow access to other machines on your local Network.

RHEL 8, we have two package repositories:

1: BaseOS

2: Application Stream

BaseOS 

Repository will contain packages like OS installation packages, Administrative tools packages and their dependencies.

AppStream 

Repository will have all remaining packages like vim, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Maven, Bind, LibreOffice and all other application and OS related dependencies.

Let us begin with creating a local Yum Repo.

you need to mount the DVD-ROM or mounted ISO in your virtual machine follow the below steps. For demonstration purpose, we are mounting under /mnt.

# mount -o loop   /dev/sr0   /mnt/

Now copy Rhel 8.0 iso to folder. First create folder and copy the iso into folder

# mkdir rhel.8_dvd

Now copy iso to folder

# cp -avr  /mnt   /rhel.8_dvd


Now move the existing repo files to /tmp or create a folder and move the files


# mv /etc/yum.repos.d/*.repo /tmp/


Create a repo file under /etc/yum.repos.d directory.

# vim  /etc/yum.repos.d/Rhel_8.0.repo


#BaseOS

[Rhel.8.0_BaseOS]
name= Rhel.8.0_BaseOS
baseurl= file:///rhel.8_dvd/BaseOS
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release

#App Stream

[Rhel.8.0_AppStream]
name= Rhel.8.0_ AppStream
baseurl= file:///rhel.8_dvd/AppStream
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey= file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release


save and exit



Details about repo directives:

[name.repo]                 Name of the Section
name                            Name of the repository
baseurl                         Location of the package
Enabled                       Enable repository
gpgcheck                     Enable secure installation and gpgcheck is optional If you set gpgcheck=0, there is no need to mention gpgkey.

gpgkey                         Location of the key

Now try to install any package:
Yum clean all

Yum install vsftpd
